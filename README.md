### Analysis

This folder holds scripts we used to process data and build graphs. Some of the outpus, results, and figures are included as well.

### Data

This folder holds processed 16S and 18S data, including OTU tables (`.biom`) and sequences of OTU centroids (`.fna`).

Genetic sequencing data is available on Zenodo for both [16S amplicons](https://zenodo.org/record/803376) and [18S amplicons](https://zenodo.org/record/803476).

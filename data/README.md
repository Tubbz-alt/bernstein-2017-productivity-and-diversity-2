# Data

### 16S_otus_vsearch

This contains the processed 16S data, including an OTU table (`.biom`),
sequences of OTU centroids (`.fna`), and some log file (`.log`).
These are all the needed inputs for the main `.Rmd` analysis script.

### 18S_otus_vsearch

This contains the processed 18S data. It's in the same format as the 16S data,
but a phylogenetic tree (`.tre`) was not produced.

### Raw data

Genetic sequencing data is available on Zenodo for both [16S amplicons](https://zenodo.org/record/803376) and [18S amplicons](https://zenodo.org/record/803476).
